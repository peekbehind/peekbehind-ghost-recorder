PeekBehind Recorder records a ghost of user activity in a web page.

FIRST STEPS
-----------

Run the unit tests by opening the files in the *tests/* folder
and read the source code and comments to get familiar with the
implementation in the *code/* folder.

You can then customize the implementation, for example adding
your own function to submit recorded data to your server.
